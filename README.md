My name is Florian and I am a biochemist who is interested in computer science and coding.  
Currently, I am participating in a "Data Science" course at the WBS-Coding School in order to broaden my skills in terms of coding in Python and anylysing data.  
My aim is to use these skills and competences in the field of bioinformatics.
